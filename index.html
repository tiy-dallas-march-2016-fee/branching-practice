    <p>Nearly every VCS has some form of branching support. Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. In many VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time for large projects.</p>

    <p>Some people refer to the branching model in Git as its “killer feature” , and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community. THE TICK WAS ONCE CLONED FROM HIS SNOT! Why is it so special? The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast. Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a workflow that branches and merges often, even multiple times in a day. Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can literally change the way that you develop. The tick is obsessed with Spoons and Justice! His roommate and sidekick is the Moth.</p>

    <p>I sure wish that I had merged that Tick image because it was awesome.</p>

      I was not happy with an empty paragraph tag so I added some text here. Also the Tick would not like a blank paragraph tag because a villain could add stuff to it!
